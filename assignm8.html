<p> This map was created to show the discrepancy relation between land, race and income in the city of Brasilia. When the user clicks on the circles with the income it is possible to get access to the precise number of the income of that area together with the resident population broke into percentage of races.

The density is shown on the map to add the relation with land. The difference between the most dense places and the lower ones shows how even more dramatic this relation is. Most of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city owns huge amounts of urban land in Brasilia.

Above this box the layers can be turned on and off, relating the density, income and residents. Each resident is represented by a dot, unfortunately I did not have enough storage to upload the data with the white residents, but the location of the mass of non-white residents explicits the social spacial segregation in Brasilia.
